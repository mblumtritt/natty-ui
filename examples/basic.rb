UI.h1 'NattyUI Basic Feature Demo', <<~TEXT

  This is a short demo of the basic features of [[75 bold]]NattyUI[[/]].

TEXT

UI.h2 'Feature: ANSI Colors and Attributes', <<~TEXT

  Like you might noticed you can [[57]]color [[d7]]text[[/]] for terminals supporting this
  feature. You can enforece the non-ANSI version by setting the environment
  variable [[75 italic]]NO_COLOR[[/]] to '[[75]]1[[/]]'. (see also [[underline]]https://no-color.org[[/]])

  You can not only color your text but also [[italic]]modify[[/]], [[underline]]decorate[[/]] and [[strike]]manipulate[[/]]
  it. The attributes are direct embedded into the text like '[[/bold red]]'
  and can be resetted with '[[//]]' or at the line end.

TEXT

UI.h2 'Feature: Sections' do |sec|
  sec.puts <<~TEXT

    Sections group text lines together and/or define their style. There are
    several section types which all can be stacked.

    Have a look at the different types of sections:

  TEXT
  sec.message 'Generic Message'
  sec.information 'Informational Message'
  sec.warning 'Warning Message'
  sec.error 'Error Message'
  sec.completed 'Completion Message'
  sec.failed 'Failure Message'
  sec.msg '[[d5]]Customized Message', symbol: 'â—‰'
  sec.space

  sec.puts 'You can stack all kinds of sections together:'
  sec.space
  sec.framed('Simple Framed Section', type: :simple) do |f1|
    f1.framed('Heavy Framed Section', type: :heavy) do |f2|
      f2.framed('Semi Framed Section', type: :semi) do |f3|
        f3.framed('Double Framed Section', type: :double) do |f4|
          f4.message(
            '[[fff400]]Frames are nice',
            "Just to show you that all sections\ncan be stacked...",
            symbol: 'ðŸ’›'
          )
        end
      end
    end
  end
