## Description

Here you find elegant, simple and beautiful tools that enhance your command line application functionally and look.

You can style your text using a [BBCode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBCode)-like syntax

```ruby
 ui.puts '[b]Hello World![/b]' # bold
 ui.puts '[i]Hello World![/i]' # italic
 ui.puts '[u]Hello World![/u]' # underline
 ui.puts '[yellow on_blue]Hello World![/]'
```

which supports all ANSI attributes, colors in 3/4-bit, 8-bit and Truecolor. There are headers, rulers, diverse message types, framed blocks and tables to layout your text. You can organize the output of tasks, use progress bars and request and handle user input. And there are text animations for fame and fun!

ðŸš€ Have a look at the [features](https://rubydoc.info/gems/natty-ui/NattyUI/Features) or check the code [examples](./examples/)!
