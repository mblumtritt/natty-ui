## TODO

Since I did not complete the tests and not all my ideas are already implemented I have this Todo list:

- test all aspects of Wrapper::Progression
- some tools to create framed text
- simple prompt
- password prompt

## Installation

You can install the gem in your system with

```shell
gem install natty-ui
```

or you can use [Bundler](http://gembundler.com/) to add NattyUI to your own project:

```shell
bundle add 'natty-ui'
```

After that you only need one line of code to have everything together

```ruby
require 'natty-ui'
```
