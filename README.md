üìï See the [online help](https://rubydoc.info/gems/natty-ui/NattyUI) and have a look at the [examples](./examples/) directory to learn from code.

### Run Examples

You can execute all examples by

```

or see the non-ANSI version

```shell
NO_COLOR=1 ruby ./examples/examples.rb
```

## Installation

You can install the gem in your system with

After that you only need one line of code to have everything together

```ruby
